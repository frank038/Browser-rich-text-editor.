# Browser-rich-text-editor.
A simple rich text editor using html standards.
It use a browser, doesn't install anything.

I found this text editor some time ago. It is an old demo.
I only add some missed features to be used nowaday:
- open and save
- print
- etc.

Very basic.
Images can be added by dropping them into the frame.
